# ‚ö´‚ö™ eOthello
 eOthello is a console-based implementation of the classic board game Othello, developed in Python. The game is built with adherence to the SOLID principles, ensuring clean, maintainable, and extensible code.

## üéÆ Game Overview

Othello is a strategic board game for two players, played on an 8x8 square board. The goal is to have the most chips on the board by the end of the game. Players alternate turns, placing their chips while flipping the opponent's chips to their side when certain conditions are met.

## üìú How to Play
### Game Rules
### 1. Players and Board
  - The game is played between two players, represented as X and O.
  - The board consists of an 8x8 grid.
### 2. Placing a Chip
  - A chip (X or O) can only be placed if it forms a straight line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) with another of the same player's chips, with one or more contiguous opponent chips in between.
### 3. Flipping Chips
  - When a valid move is made, all contiguous opponent chips between the placed chip and another of the player's chips are flipped to the player's side.
  - This flipping process can occur in multiple directions from the placed chip.
### 4. Winning Condition
  - The player with the most chips on the board at the end of the game is declared the winner.

## ‚ú® Features
- Fully functional Othello gameplay on a console interface.
